CaptionCraft: Image to Subtitle Conversion
Project Description
CaptionCraft is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload images and get AI-generated captions. Using advanced AI models, the system can interpret the content of the image and produce a descriptive text (subtitle). The application also allows users to download the generated caption and provide feedback on the generated text.

The project leverages the BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining) model from the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform the image-to-text conversion. The project is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive web interface where users can upload images and view the generated captions.

Features
Upload an image and get an AI-generated caption
Download the caption as a text file
View the uploaded image alongside its caption
Provide feedback on the generated caption
User-friendly interface built using Flask and HTML/CSS
